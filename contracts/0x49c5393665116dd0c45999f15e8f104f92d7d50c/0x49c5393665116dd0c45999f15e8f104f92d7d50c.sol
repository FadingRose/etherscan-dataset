realistic and engaging trading experience without the risk of financial loss. By simulating the dynamics 
of the cryptocurrency market, Excryon enables users to practice trading strategies, manage virtual portfolios, 
and track their progress as they advance through various levels of trading proficiency.
Excryon is structured around a unique leveling system where users start as an Anchovy and can advance through 
ten distinct levels, ultimately aiming to become a Whale. Each level unlocks exclusive visual elements and 
provides a sense of progression and achievement. The platform features detailed asset management tools, including 
portfolio tracking, average cost price calculations, and profit/loss assessments. Users can also engage in buying 
and selling cryptocurrencies within the simulation, honing their trading skills and strategies.
Purpose and Vision
The purpose of Excryon is to create an immersive and educational environment for individuals interested in 
cryptocurrency trading. By providing a risk-free platform, Excryon allows users to experiment with different 
trading strategies, learn from their mistakes, and build confidence in their trading abilities. The vision behind 
Excryon is to democratize access to cryptocurrency trading education, making it accessible to everyone regardless 
of their financial background or experience level.
Excryon aims to foster a community of informed and skilled traders who can apply their knowledge in real-world 
scenarios. By gamifying the learning process and introducing a competitive element through ranking and progression 
systems, Excryon strives to make the journey of learning cryptocurrency trading enjoyable and motivating.
Disclaimer
It is important to note that Excryon is a simulation application, and all trading activities, balances, and 
profit/loss values within the platform are entirely fictional. There is no real money involved, and the outcomes 
of simulated trades have no real-world financial implications. Excryon is intended solely for educational and 
entertainment purposes. Users should not interpret the performance of their virtual trades as indicative of real-world 
trading success.
